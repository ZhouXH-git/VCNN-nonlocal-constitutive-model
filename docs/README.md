# VCNN - Vector Cloud Neural Network
The vector-cloud neural network (VCNN) is a promising tool not only as nonlocal constitutive models and but also as general surrogate models for PDEs on irregular domains. It is a frame-independent neural network, strictly invariant both to coordinate translation and rotation and to the ordering of points in the cloud. The network can deal with any number of arbitrarily arranged grid points and thus is suitable for unstructured meshes in fluid simulations.
